# Exercise 4

In this exercise, you will learn how to use Testcontainers to use a generic container. First, you'll create a container object of type `org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer`. Later, you'll build the container on-the-fly.

> **_NOTE:_** You can choose to run the build using Maven or Gradle. Pick the tool you are most comfortable with.

1. In the existing test class, create a `GenericContainer` that uses the image named `nginx:1.21.3`. The test code should be able to reach the endpoint of the Ngix container.
2. Run the test and verify its correct behavior. For Maven the command is `./mvnw test`, for Gradle the command is `./gradlew test`. The console output should indicate that the container has been created and destroyed after the test finished.
3. Instead of using a pre-built Nginx, build the container using the provided Dockerfile.
4. Run the test and verify its correct behavior. For Maven the command is `./mvnw test`, for Gradle the command is `./gradlew test`. The console output should indicate that the container has been created and destroyed after the test finished.
5. Instead of using the Dockerfile, build the container with individual instructions defined by Testcontainers method calls.
6. Run the test and verify its correct behavior. For Maven the command is `./mvnw test`, for Gradle the command is `./gradlew test`. The console output should indicate that the container has been created and destroyed after the test finished.
